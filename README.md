# PCMRBot
## A Twitch bot, because we can.
## [PCMRBot Website](http://pcmrbot.no-ip.info)

#Usage
You should be able to download the sources and compile with your login and OAuth code and run the bot. You don't have to have a second twitch account, but you can.

However you must create a MySQL Database on your localhost and create a user with the login of "bot", all lower case without the quotes.

To run the bot open a command prompt and type "java -jar /path/to/jar.jar OAUTH Databse_Password" without the quotes. The bot will then join your channel!

#Features
The bot is essentially a xanbot clone, but with two key differences. It is open source and has points! Each user has points and once they reach 288 (the eqivalent of 24 hours in chat) they become a regular and are exempt from all spam protection. (This is probably going to change slightly in the future, just not sure how)

#Contribution
If you are contributing to the code through Pull Requests make sure to do so to the bleeding branch. If you do not the PR will be immediately closed and you will be reminded to use the bleeding branch.
